A phaser is an audio effect that alters the sound of a signal by creating phase shifts at various frequencies. This results in a unique, sweeping sound characterized by a series of notches and peaks in the frequency spectrum.

# Key Characteristics of a Phaser

## Phase Shifting:
The phaser effect works by splitting the audio signal into two paths. One path remains unchanged, while the other is processed to introduce a phase shift. The two signals are then mixed back together, causing certain frequencies to cancel each other out (notches) and others to reinforce (peaks).

## Multi-Stage Filters:
A typical phaser consists of multiple stages (or filters). Each stage applies its own phase shift, and the number of stages can affect the richness and complexity of the sound. More stages can create a thicker, more pronounced effect.

## LFO Modulation:
The amount of phase shift is often modulated over time using a Low-Frequency Oscillator (LFO). This modulation causes the notches and peaks to move up and down the frequency spectrum, creating the characteristic sweeping sound of a phaser.

# How It Differs from Other Effects

* Phaser vs. Flanger:
        Both phasers and flangers create similar sweeping sounds, but they do so in different ways. Flanging involves a short delay combined with feedback, while phasing is purely based on phase shifts without delays.

* Phaser vs. Chorus:
        Chorus effects create a thickening sound by slightly detuning multiple copies of the original signal. In contrast, phasers create a more dynamic, shifting sound through phase manipulation.
