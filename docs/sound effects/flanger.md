# What is a flanger effet?
A flanger is an audio effect that creates a distinctive, swooshing, or jet-like sound by mixing two identical signals together, with one of the signals delayed by a small and variable amount of time. This delay is modulated over time, 
which results in a series of peaks and troughs in the frequency response of the combined signal.

# Key Components of the Flanger Effect

## Delay 
The core of the flanger effect is a delay line. 
  One signal is delayed by a small amount (typically a few milliseconds) compared to the other. 
  This delay can vary over time, creating the characteristic sound.
## Modulation
The delay time is modulated, usually using a low-frequency oscillator (LFO).
  This modulation causes the delay to change continuously, which alters the phase relationship between the two signals.
  The LFO can typically be set to different rates and depths, affecting how pronounced the flanging effect is.
## Mixing
The delayed signal is mixed back with the original signal. 
  The mix level can be adjusted to emphasize the flanging effect.
  Often, a feedback loop is also introduced where a portion of the output is fed back into the input, enhancing the effect.
## Phase Cancellation
The combination of the two signals can lead to constructive and destructive interference, 
  resulting in characteristic "notches" or "peaks" in the frequency spectrum.
  This gives the flanger its unique sound.

# Characteristics of the Flanger Sound

* Swooshing Effect: The modulation of the delay creates a sweeping, whooshing sound that can be very dynamic.
* Jet-Like Quality: Itâ€™s often described as sounding like a jet plane, particularly when applied to sustained sounds or chords.
* Versatility: Flanging can be applied to various audio sources, including vocals, guitars, synthesizers, and drums, adding depth and interest to the sound.
