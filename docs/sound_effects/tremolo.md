Tremolo
===

Tremolo is an audio effect that modulates the amplitude (volume) of a sound signal over time, creating a rhythmic variation in loudness. It's commonly used in music to add texture, movement, and dynamics to audio.

# Key Characteristics of Tremolo

## Amplitude Modulation:
Tremolo works by varying the amplitude of a sound signal. This modulation can create a pulsating effect, where the sound fades in and out at a regular rate.

## Waveform:
The modulation is typically created using a periodic waveform, most commonly a sine wave. The frequency of this waveform determines how quickly the volume changes.

## Depth of Modulation:
The depth (or intensity) of the modulation controls how much the volume varies. A shallow depth results in subtle changes, while a deep depth creates a more pronounced effect.

## Speed of Modulation:
The speed (or rate) of the modulation is measured in Hertz (Hz) and indicates how many times per second the amplitude changes. Faster rates create a rapid "pulsing" effect, while slower rates produce a more drawn-out, soothing sound.

# How Tremolo Differs from Other Effects
* Tremolo vs. Vibrato:
        While tremolo modulates amplitude, vibrato modulates pitch. Tremolo affects how loud or quiet a sound is, whereas vibrato creates a fluctuation in pitch.
* Tremolo vs. Phaser/Flanger:
        Tremolo affects the volume, while phasers and flangers manipulate the phase of the signal, creating a different type of sound characterized by sweeping notches in the frequency spectrum.
