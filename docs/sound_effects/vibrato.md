Vibrato
===

Vibrato is a musical technique that involves a slight, periodic variation in pitch and/or volume of a note. It adds expressiveness and warmth to music. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:
# Definition
Vibrato is a rapid oscillation of pitch (or sometimes volume) around a central note. It creates a pulsating effect that enhances the emotional quality of the sound.

# Types of Vibrato
* Pitch Vibrato: The most common form, where the pitch fluctuates slightly above and below the intended note. This is often measured in cents (1 cent = 1/100th of a semitone).
* Volume Vibrato: Involves fluctuations in loudness rather than pitch. This is less common but can be used for specific effects.
